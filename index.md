`This is a placeholder personal site. One day I'll get bored and make a real one.` Until then:

## Projects

### Pi-llups

Working title. This is a pullup detector, tracker, and analyzer I built with a Raspberry Pi, some hardware, a Django server, and a few Python scripts.

### Do It Again!

This is a 2 star video game I made using Unity and c#. It's not particularly fun, but it is a video game. Has a boss battle and everything, if you can figure out how to make it that far. Shoutout to Wesley Schmidt for the art.

### Big Jerk

A random insult generator built in NodeJS to get a free Amazon Echo Dot. Say "enable Big Jerk" to your Alexa-enabled device to have some PG13 "fun"!

### Drumm Farm

A Django website built and maintained for a charity in Missouri that helps foster families.
