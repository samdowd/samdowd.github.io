## Projects

### [Pi-llups](http://pullups.mdowd.me/)

Working title. This is a pullup detector, tracker, and analyzer I built with a Raspberry Pi, some hardware, a Django server, and a few Python scripts.

### [Do It Again!](http://www.kongregate.com/games/sadmowd/do-it-again)

This is a 2 star video game I made using Unity and c#. It's not particularly fun, but it is a video game. Has a boss battle and everything, if you can figure out how to make it that far. Shoutout to Wesley Schmidt for the art.

### [Big Jerk](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07349SDZG/)

A random insult generator built in NodeJS to get a free Amazon Echo Dot. Say "enable Big Jerk" to your Alexa-enabled device to have some PG13 "fun"!

### [Drumm Farm](http://www.drummfarm.org/)

A Django website built and maintained for a charity in Missouri that helps foster families.
